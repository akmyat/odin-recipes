    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This classic Thai disk has spectacular taste even with regular basil instead of Thai holy basil.
        The sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat.
        The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced shallots</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 cups hot cooked rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                Heat large skillet over high heat.
                Drizzle in oil.
                Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes.
                Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies.
                Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes.
                Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.

            <p>
                Pour in the rest of the sauce.
                Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan.
                Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes.
                Remove from heat.
            </p>

            <p>
                Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.
